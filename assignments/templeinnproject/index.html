            <p>Positioned on Salt Lake City's center block, known as Temple Square, the spires of the
                Salt Lake Temple rise amid downtown high-rises and super malls.
                The Salt Lake Temple was the fourth temple built in Utah (though its construction was
                started first) and the first built in the Salt Lake Valley.
                <br>
                The Salt Lake Temple was the only temple dedicated by President Wilford Woodruff.
                With its distinctive spires and statue of the angel Moroni, the Salt Lake Temple is an
                international symbol of the Church.
                <br>
                The Salt Lake Temple is the largest temple (most square footage) of the Church.
